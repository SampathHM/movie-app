| **Frontend** | Hosted on **Netlify** for fast, reliable, and continuous deployment. |
| **Backend**  | Deployed on **Render** for API and database services.                |

**Movie-Central** operates using a client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Built with **React**, it handles all user interactions like browsing movies, viewing reviews, and managing user accounts. It communicates with the backend via API calls.
2. **Backend**: Powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, the backend processes requests from the frontend, handling movie data, user authentication, and more.
3. **Database**: **PostgreSQL** stores all movie data, user profiles, and reviews, ensuring data is stored persistently and can be queried efficiently.
4. **Authentication**: Users sign up and log in to access personalized features such as favorites, reviews, and movie groups. Authentication is managed securely through the auth0 api and @auth0/auth0-react package.

## Installation and Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/group13-Advanced-Web-Project/movie-app.git`

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   Navigate to the frontend and backend directories and install the required packages:

   - Frontend:  
     `cd frontend && npm install`
   - Backend:  
     `cd backend && npm install`

3. **Set up environment variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories and add the required environment variables.

   ### FRONTEND .env

   - **Server URL**  
     - `REACT_APP_API_URL=`

   - **TMDB API Key**  
     - `REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=`



   ### BACKEND .env

   - **Database Connection Details**
     - `DB_USER=`
     - `DB_HOST=`
     - `DB_PORT=`
     - `DB_PASSWORD=`
     - `DB_NAME=`

   - **TMDB API Key**  
     - `TMDB_API_KEY=`





4. **Set up PostgreSQL**:

   - Create a local or cloud PostgreSQL database.
   - Refer to \movie-app\backend\index.js for database initialization.

5. Replace auth0 details

- To create your own user list and have control over user login and access.
- Create an account at https://auth0.com/
- Create a single page application on auth0 dashboard
- Under your application settings tab, add to Allowed Callback URLs and Allowed Logout URLs:

http://localhost:3000/

note: Change the port number if required, and add relevant domain URL if you dploy to live site.

- Replace frontend/index.js Auth0Provider domain and clientId details


6. **Start the application**:
   - Run the backend server:  
     `cd backend && npm start`
   - Run the frontend server:  
     `cd frontend && npm start`

The app should now be running locally at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/).

## Responsiveness

CSS is used to provide suitable layout views for different screen sizes:

 Desktop view:

![Responsiveness ](docs/assets/responsiveness/responsiveness-desktop.png)


 Tablet view:

![Responsiveness ](docs/assets/responsiveness/responsiveness-tablet.png)
 

 Phone view:

![Responsiveness ](docs/assets/responsiveness/responsiveness-phone.png)

## Sign up

auth0 is used for our user creation and management.

After clicking the login button (top right of screen), the user is shown the sign up screen.

![Sign up ](docs/assets/sign-up/sign-up.png)

The user has the option to create an account using their google account, or provide a username and password.

If the user provides a username and password, the password must meet the strong requirements.

![Sign up password](docs/assets/sign-up/sign-up-password.png)


## Sign in

**IMPORTANT** 

If you have not added your own auth0 details 

 Allowed Callback URLs
 - http://localhost:3000/
 - https://movie-app-group13.netlify.app/


 Allowed Logout URLs
  - http://localhost:3000/
  - https://movie-app-group13.netlify.app/

**IMPORTANT** 

After the user has created an account, they can log in using the same screen on the Log in tab.

![Sign In ](docs/assets/sign-in/sign-in.png)

After the user signs in, the users details are checked against our database. 
If they do not have any information in our database, then they are added using their auth0 user.sub (making use of the @auth0/auth0-react package).

## Removing account

To remove account:

1. Navigate to the profile page by clicking the user profile link (top right next to Log Out).

![Profile page ](docs/assets/remove-account/remove-account-profile.png)

2. On the left of the screen in the profile details section,at the bottom the remove account button can be found.

![Remove account button ](docs/assets/remove-account/remove-account-profile-remove-btn.png)

3. After clicking the remove account button, the profile details will be removed from our database. Any data that used the profile information that has been deleted (such as reviews) will now be replaced with a indicator the account that written the review has been deleted.

4. If the account was part of, or owner of a group. The ownership will automatically be transferred.

## Search

The search results have been limited to **200 results per return**, this is intentional to avoid rate-limiting from the external API.
As a result, some movies may not show in results.

## Deployment

For deployment we used free tiers from Netlify (frontend) and render (server and database).

- Frontend deployed using Netlify:

**Netlify Build Settings**

![Build Settings](docs/assets/deployment/buildsettings.png)

## Documenting REST API

Rest API documentation can be found through the following link:

[API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/39714216/2sAYHwHjEx)


## Managing product backlog

The product was tracked using a Github project board:

https://github.com/orgs/group13-Advanced-Web-Project/projects/2

![Project Board](docs/assets/project-board.png)

The board is separated into two main tags, Backlog and Bug tracker.

Backlog was populated with all the required tasks to be completed over the whole project, and then additional filtered kanban board were created for team members to easily find their assigned tasks. Teh priority system was used to identify which tasks were to be worked on next.

Bug tracker was used to keep track of any bugs and assigned to the relevant team member, the priority system was also used in the same way.

The timeline tab is used to see a  all of the issues that have been worked on and completed throughout the project, this is filtered by start date to end date.
## Version control

For version control, we decided to use a open source methodology of forking and having 1 person manage all of the pull requests to minimize merge conflicts.
![Project Board](docs/assets/network-graph.png)

This allowed us to deploy from one branch, and use team members forks and pull request branches for feature development and bug fixes.

## Overall project management and progress

The team stayed on progress by first having a kick off meeting where the following was decided (notes from meetings can be found in docs/note):

1. Target grade
2. Previous project experience and lessons learned
3. Tech stack we will use
4. Role assignments
5. Project management risks and mitigations
6. Weekly meeting schedule

We decided a minimum of 3 weekly meetings were required along with a good use of web messaging and github communication.

- Monday meeting: Talk through the weeks tasks and priorities and prepare for mentor meeting
- Mentor meeting: Talk through progress, blockers and ensure all requirements are understood and worked towards effectively
- Check up meeting: Progress report on the Monday meeting, and any additional resources are need

This format worked well and kept our team moving forwards at a good pace with sufficient communication.
